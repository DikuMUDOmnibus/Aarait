WHAT IS THIS?

anything like it before.

Nethack style graphics.
Totally Original World.

Aarait is a 'proof of concept' mud. I wanted to see if it was possible to make a mud that
did not involve killing or rp, while remaining fun. Aarait does this beautifully. It's not
for everyone though, I've found that four out of five new players type kill a few times,
figure out it doesn't work and quit, never to be seen again. Those that stay love it.

Aarait works in every aspect, is very playable, there are no 'crash' bugs. While being more
complete than 90% of muds on the Internet it lacks a certain polish that keeps me from 
considering it finished.
